    "SEAHORSE (Serendipity Engine Assaying Heterogenous Omics-Related Sampling Experiments) is a tool for exploratory data analysis designed to allow users to identify both expected and unexpected associations within large data sets; SEAHORSE allows users to ask and answer questions about individual variables or cohorts. Given gene expression and clinical data from a particular cohort such as a specific tissue from the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project or a particular cancer type from The CancerGenome Atlas (TCGA), seahorse identifies pairs of most correlated genes, and also genes and biological pathways strongly associated to any given phenotype.\n",
