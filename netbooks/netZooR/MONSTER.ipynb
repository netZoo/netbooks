    "\n",
    "MONSTER<sup>1</sup> (MOdeling Network State Transitions from Expression and Regulatory data) is a tool for identifying the transcription factor that drive a transition from an initial network to final gene regulatory network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific cellular states are often associated with distinct gene expression patterns. These states are plastic, changing during development, or in the transition from health to disease. One relatively simple extension of this concept is to recognize that we can classify different cell-types by their active gene regulatory networks and that, consequently, transitions between cellular states can be modeled by changes in these underlying regulatory networks. This package is an implementation of MONSTER, MOdeling Network State Transitions from Expression and Regulatory data, a regression-based method for inferring transcription factor drivers of cell state conditions at the gene regulatory network level.\n",
    "\n",
    "MONSTER takes in sequence motif data linking transcription factors (TFs) to genes and gene expression from two conditions. The goal is generate bipartite networks from the gene expression data which quantify evidence of the regulatory roles of each of the TFs to each of the genes. Next, critical TFs are identified by computing a transition matrix, which maps the gene regulatory network in the first state to the gene regulatory network in the second state."
